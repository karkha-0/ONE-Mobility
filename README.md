# The ONE-Mobility

EIT, Lund University, Sweden, has updated this version of the Opportunistic Network Environment simulator to enable JSON mobility tracing.

Mobility-enabled simulation scenarios are located under sim_Scenario/CaseIDs/Mobility-CaseIDs.

The mobility traces could be adapted to log geo-coord traces or sector traces. Sector traces are an adaptation where the world map is divided into cells representing gNodeB or eNodeB in a grid layout, and the mobility traces track Node movements across the world's sectors. 

Some new movement classes have been created, including anomaly movements of tuple-like movements under InstantJumpMovement.

For instructions on how to get started with ONE simulator, see [README](https://github.com/akeranen/the-one/wiki/README).
